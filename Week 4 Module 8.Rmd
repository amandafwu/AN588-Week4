## Challenge 1
```{r Challenge 1}
#Write a function to simulate rolling a die where you pass the number of rolls as an argument. Then, use your function to simulate rolling two dice 1000 times and take the sum of the rolls. Plot a histogram of those results.

```

# Troubleshooting:
* Error message when uploading the first histogram 
    + Error: "attempt to use zero-length variable name"
